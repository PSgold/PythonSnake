This is a simple snake game.
Python 3 needs to be installed on your system https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Pygame needs to be installed https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
Make sure the default.pickle file is in the same Directory as the main snakeSY.py file
The game should run on both Windows and Linux, however on linux you might need to change the py file line endings to unix style.
